# Classification Project

In this project, I created different CNN models to classify 1500  weather images into 4 categories.
defining model architectures using transfer learning, dropout, and data augmentation.

## First Model:
Classification with CNN without Transfer Learning with Dropout. The best accuracy i got is 91.96% with the following architecture:

</p>

## Second Model:
CNN with dropout and data augmentation. improves the accuracy to  92.92% with the following architecture:

</p>

## VGG16 Model:
Transfer Learning using the VGG16 model with data augmentation and normalization.
obtained an accuracy of  %95.54 on the test set.
